# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

A data analytics project that visualizes and analyzes **heart disease survival and risk factors** using a clinical dataset.  
The interactive Power BI dashboard highlights patient demographics, medical attributes, and lifestyle factors to uncover patterns influencing heart disease outcomes.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Demographics Analysis** – Age and gender-based survival distribution  
- 🩺 **Medical Factors** – Blood pressure, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, anaemia, diabetes  
- 📉 **Survival Insights** – Total deaths, total survival, average survival age, overall survival rate  
- 🔍 **Comparisons** – Healthy vs Diseased groups by age group and clinical indicators  
- 🎛️ **Interactive Filters** – Gender and lifestyle risk factors (smoking, diabetes, anaemia, high BP)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard & visualization  
- **Excel (.xlsx)** – Dataset source  
- **Dataset** – Heart Disease dataset (included in `/data`)  

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Patients aged **40–60** exhibit the highest survival rates compared to other groups.  
- **Serum creatinine** levels and **low ejection fraction** strongly correlate with higher mortality.  
- Lifestyle and medical factors such as **smoking, anaemia, high blood pressure, and diabetes** significantly increase the risk of heart disease.  
- Gender-based analysis shows a slightly higher risk in **males** compared to females.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add a **correlation heatmap** of clinical features for deeper statistical analysis.  
- Integrate a **machine learning model** to predict heart disease risk.  
- Deploy the dashboard online via **Power BI Service** for broader accessibility.
